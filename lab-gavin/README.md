# This is my awesome example of the power of Javascript! #

## I have demonstrated how to order readFile information based on the dev's choices, rather than how big the file is ##

## I tested my code to ensure that the order of the readFile data is as it should be. ##

### done() was used throughout this project to demonstrate javascript and asynchronous. With done() if my tests take longer that 2-3 seconds they wont auto fail/pass. It also allows the first test block to completely run, then finish before finishing my second test. ###

### To use done you simply place it as an argument in your test function, then call done() with its method call at the end of the specific test block. ###
